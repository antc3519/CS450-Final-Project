Final Project for CS450 - Introduction to Data Visualization

In this project, you will propose a one-page dashboard to display the information in your dataset. Your goal is to include as much information as possible, with a minimum of 12 columns, meeting the following requirements:
1. Interactive Components: Your dashboard must include at least one dropdown or radio button and one slider. These components will control two different visualization elements, allowing users to interact with and update the data displayed dynamically.
2. Visualization Components: The dashboard must include at least two types of visualizations, with one selected from Option 1 and the other from Option 2:
   * Option 1: bar chart, scatterplot, pie chart, heatmap, line chart 
   * Option 2: stacked bar chart, stacked histogram, tree diagram, or geographic plot. 
There are no restrictions on adding additional visualizations. However, at least two visualizations must be dynamic, updating in response to user interactions with dropdowns, radio buttons, or sliders. If the minimum required visualizations do not sufficiently encode all 12 columns of information, consider adding more. During the design process, aim to optimize your use of visualizations: if three visualizations can effectively display the information, adding a fourth would be unnecessary.
3. Other Requirements: Ensure that the dashboard design is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Avoid using unnecessary colors, cluttered text, or overlapping elements to ensure readability and a positive user experience. When encoding data, aim to minimize the number of visualizations by effectively using multiple channels (e.g., color, size, position) while adhering to the principles of effectiveness and expressiveness. The goal is to communicate the data clearly and efficiently, without overwhelming the user with too many visual elements.
